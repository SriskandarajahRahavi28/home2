    <h2>Rukmini Devi Arundale</h2> <!-- Famous Artist 1 (header 2), description, and images -->
    <p class="text1">Rukmini Devi Arundale was one of the key dancers to revive Bharatanatyam after it was banned by the British during their colonial rule over India. She is credited with disassociating Bharatanatyam from its Devadasi origin, a part of Bharatanatyam she thought was no longer needed. She toured with her husband all over Europe and worked to restore Bharatanatyam to its former glory. Ms. Arundale developed new ways for dancers to wear jewelry, makeup, and costumes. She also expanded and remodeled the instrumental use for Bharatanatyam performances, going from 1 instrument to around 4-5. After her reintroduction and reformation of Bharatanatyam for mainstream audiences all over the world, the era of post-colonial Bharatanatyam began. Her work to modernize Bharatanatyam was highly praised, and Mrs. Arundale was even offered the post of President of India for all her hard work, which she turned down. Up until she died in 1986, Mrs. Arundale created various pieces surrounding ancient Hindu mythological epics and stories, one of which was the "Ramayana," a story that is still well-known today. Mrs. Arundale is known to have had a crucial role in reviving Bharatanatyam and is a vital part of Bharatanatyam's 2000+ years of history.</p>
